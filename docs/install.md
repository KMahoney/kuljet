* [Install Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/).
* Clone the [repository](https://github.com/KMahoney/kuljet) and change to its directory.
* `stack install kuljet`

You should now have the `kuljet` command available.

Make sure you have the output of `stack path --local-bin` in your `PATH`.
